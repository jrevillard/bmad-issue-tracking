# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## What this is

BMAD extension module that integrates sprint tracking with GitLab/GitHub Issues. It's not a runnable application — it's a set of TOML overrides and skills deployed into consuming BMAD projects via the BMAD installer (`npx bmad-method install`).

Requires BMM 6.4.0+ (uniform customize.toml support across all BMM workflows).

## Architecture

Two concepts that must stay aligned:

- **Standalone skill** (`skills/bmad-bmm-issue-sync/SKILL.md`) — the user-facing slash command (`/bmad-bmm-issue-sync`) and the single source of truth for the sync task
- **Deployed copy** — during setup, this file is copied to `_bmad/_config/custom/bmad-bmm-issue-sync.md` in the consuming project. TOML `on_complete` hooks reference this deployed path.

The standalone skill IS the source. If you edit it, the deployed copy in consuming projects won't update automatically — users must re-run `/bmad-issue-tracking-setup`.

## TOML override semantics

Files in `skills/bmad-issue-tracking-setup/assets/custom/` are TOML overrides for BMM workflows:
- `[workflow] activation_steps_append` — array, appends to BMM's activation steps
- `[workflow] on_complete` — scalar, replaces BMM's completion block entirely

All overrides are pure pointers — they reference workflow YAML files that handle the actual logic. The config guard (`common/check-config.yaml` validating `issue_tracking.platform`, `issue_tracking.branch_patterns`, etc.) runs inside each workflow YAML, not in the TOML.

## Key variable conventions in instructions

TOML instructions reference these placeholders — they are NOT config variables, they're resolved at runtime by the AI agent:
- `{prd_key}` — from PRD frontmatter, e.g. `mobile-oidc`
- `{story_key}` — sprint-status entry key, e.g. `1-3-login-form`
- `{epic_num}`, `{story_num}` — extracted from `story_key` (first two dash-separated numbers)
- `{prd_branch}` — `branch_patterns.prd` resolved with `{prd_key}`, e.g. `feat/mobile-oidc/prd`
- `{story_branch}` — `branch_patterns.story` resolved with `{prd_key}` and `{story_key}`
- `{sep}` — `::` for GitLab, `:` for GitHub (label separator)
- `$MR_HOST`, `$MR_PROJECT` — git remote host/project for MR operations (GitLab); same as `$HOST`/`$PROJECT_PATH` when platforms match
- `$MR_OWNER`, `$MR_REPO` — git remote owner/repo for PR operations (GitHub); same as `$OWNER`/`$REPO` when platforms match

## Branch/MR flow

Branch setup happens in activation (before BMM workflow runs). The BMM workflow creates files directly in the worktree. on_complete handles commit/push/issue/MR. Never commit on PRD for story work.

| Workflow | Activation | on_complete | MR direction |
|----------|-----------|-------------|--------------|
| create-prd | Create/switch to PRD worktree | Commit + push + issue + draft MR | PRD → default (draft) |
| create-architecture | Switch to PRD worktree | Commit + push | (PRD worktree) |
| create-ux-design | Switch to PRD worktree | Commit + push | (PRD worktree) |
| create-epics-and-stories | Switch to PRD worktree | Commit + push | (PRD worktree) |
| sprint-planning | Switch to PRD worktree | Trigger full issue sync | (PRD worktree) |
| edit-prd | Switch to PRD worktree | Update PRD issue description | (PRD worktree) |
| check-implementation-readiness | Switch to PRD worktree | Update issue descriptions if artifacts modified | (PRD worktree) |
| correct-course | Switch to PRD worktree | Update issue descriptions if artifacts modified | (PRD worktree) |
| retrospective | Switch to PRD worktree | Create retrospective issue + close | (PRD worktree) |
| create-story | Ask story key, create/switch to story worktree (from PRD) | Commit + push + issue + MR | story → PRD |
| dev-story | Find story with status `ready-for-dev`, switch to worktree | Commit + push + update issue | (MR from create-story) |
| code-review | Find story with status `review`, switch to worktree | Commit + push + post review + optional merge | story → PRD |
| sprint-status | Switch to PRD worktree | Trigger full issue sync | (none) |

## Platform differences

- GitLab: `glab` CLI, labels use `::` separator, `glab api` for issue updates (labels field replaces all), `glab label create` for labels
- GitHub: `gh` CLI, labels use `:` separator, `gh api` for label updates (fetch + filter + replace, same pattern as GitLab)
- `glab api` uses `--hostname`; `glab mr`/`glab label` use `-R`; `gh` uses `-R` with format `[HOST/]OWNER/REPO`

**Git remote vs issue tracker:** The git remote (origin) and issue tracker can be on different platforms (e.g., code on GitLab, issues on GitHub). `issue_tracking.platform` is the issue tracker; `issue_tracking.git_platform` (set during setup) is the git remote. Issue operations (create/update/close issues, labels, comments) use `platform`. MR/PR operations (list, create, merge, mark ready) use `git_platform`. When they differ, `host`/`project` apply to the issue tracker and `git_host`/`git_project` apply to the git remote. Issue references in MR descriptions use `Closes #X` for same-platform, full URL for cross-platform.

## Files to update when adding a new BMM workflow override

1. Create `skills/bmad-issue-tracking-setup/assets/custom/bmad-{workflow}.toml` (pointer format — activation_steps_append and/or on_complete)
2. Create the corresponding workflow YAML files in `skills/bmad-issue-tracking-setup/assets/workflows/{workflow}/`
3. Add the TOML file to the list in `skills/bmad-issue-tracking-setup/SKILL.md` (step 3)
4. Add the YAML files to the list in `skills/bmad-issue-tracking-setup/SKILL.md` (step 3b)
5. Add a row to the override table in `README.md`
6. Update `module-help.csv` if the workflow has a standalone skill

## Python environment

Tests use `pytest` and `pyyaml`. Always use the project venv — never `pip3 install --break-system-packages`:
```bash
python3 -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate && pip install pytest pyyaml
```

## Version alignment

When bumping `module.yaml` version, also update `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` plugin version to match.
